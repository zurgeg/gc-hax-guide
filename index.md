# HaxCube: A simple Gamecube Hax Guide

## Methods

### Save Exploits
Save Exploits are probably the safest and easiest way to load hax on your GameCube.
You will need:
- A compatible game
- A memory card with at least ~200 blocks available (preferably SD to GameCube adapters, also known as SDGecko)
- An SD card (only if you used an SDGecko)
- A GameCube or Wii that is capable of loading homebrew and reading memory cards (only if you didn't use an SDGecko)
Instructions for this method can be found [here](#)
